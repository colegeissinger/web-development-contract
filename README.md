## Web Development Contract
This is the boilerplate I use for web development contracts.

Feel free to use it in your own work, contribute to the discussion by bringing up issues.

Originally created by (Eric Andrew Luis)[https://github.com/ericandrewlewis/web-development-contract], then expanded to match terminology and needs for myself and added an SOW.
